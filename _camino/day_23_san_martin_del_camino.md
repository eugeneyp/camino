Energized from the rest at Leon, I walked today with almost no break. 

I wrote in my journal:
> Federico wanted me to remember that all pilgrims are one family. His mission: to greet pilgrims, and so I was the priority to him that day. Very concrete. 

> Walked with dynamic energy. I am a dynamic process. Things always changing and unfolding.
