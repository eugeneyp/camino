Today, I walked excitelyd to Rabanal del Camino, a little town up on a hill. From the beginning, I marked this town as a must-stop. It was the only town on the Camino with a Benedictine monastery that I knew of that welcomed guests.

For days, I emailed and called the monastery without receiving a response. So I wanted to get there to see if they were open. I had read about the Benedictines. I loved their monastic ethos, and I really wanted to experience it from the inside.

At the monastery, I found the gift shop open. Brother Clement received me. I was told all the guest spaces in the monastery were occupied at the moment, and since they let guests decide for themselves when they would leave, they do not know when they would have more space. I made sure my name was on his list if spaces opened up. Then I checked into an albergue right beside it. When I checked later again that day, I was told I can move into the monastery tomorrow. I was elated. 

The albergue I stayed at was also lovely. It was ran by an association of volunteers. Like many encounters on the Camino, it was an offering from generosity. There I met Uve from Germany, whom like me, will be staying with the Benedictines.

A beautiful poem I came across in the albergue:
> When we started, we did not know - exactly - why we were doing it
> We had lives which were - more or less - satisfactory
> We had friends know much of our lives
> We had children - changed from chrysalis to butterflies
> We had things:
> 		things like machines
> 		things like music
> 		things like pictures
> 		things like shelves full of books
> 		things like money and pensions and security
> We did not have one thing – and maybe was why we started
> 
> When we started, we put one foot in front of the other
> We still did not know – precisely – why we were doing it
> The miles passed – many of them pleasantly
> Out feet blistered and were slow to heal
> Our ankled turned on loose stones
> The rain beat its way through our clothes
> The cold chilled the marrow of our bones
> Some nights, refuge was hard to find
> Some days, miles of hot dust had no fountains
> 
> When the first few of many long days had passed
> We found – without words – that we no longer walked together
> That together we spoke often in our own tongues – 
> 			and often of things we had left behind where we began
> That together we shut out new experiences within the wall of our togetherness
> That alone we spoke in other tongues and of our common experience
> That alone we were open – open with interest and curiosity.
> Often we met – with gladness – at the end of the day
> To know our paths went on together was enough
> 
> When we got to the cathedral we sat down
> We saw – through the eyes of those long before us
> The blinding faith, the crucial thirst for salvation
> The tower slowly closing off the sky
> And we counted our blessings – several hundred of them
> Starting with the kindness of the ordinary people on the way
> And with the warmth of other travelers on the road
> Travelers not at all like us – not in age, not in origin, not in interests
> But warm across all these distancings
> And ending with friendship and love
> We had left behind where we began.
> 
> When we got to the sea at the end of the world
> We sat down on the beach at sunset
> We knew why we had done it
> To know our lives less important than just one grain of sand
> To know that we did not need the things we had left behind us
> To know that we would nevertheless return to them
> To know that we needed to be where we belonged
> To know that kindness and friendship and love is all one needs
> To know that we did not – after all – have to make this long journey to find this out
> To know that – for us – it certainly helped
