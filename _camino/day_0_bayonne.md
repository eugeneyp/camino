I left London, flew to Biarritz, then took a bus to Bayonne, my first stop on the Camino.

In my journal, I wrote: 
> The beginning of journeying  
> The end of seeking  
> A heart uncontainable, anticipating.  
> A whisper in the wind:   
> 	I give myself wholly to you.

Paul, a good friend I met at the Men's Rite of Passage the year before, hosted me with his wife Liz in London over the weekend. He served a hearty breakfast for the start of my journey.

Arriving at the doorsteps of the albergue in Bayonne (a refuge for pilgrims on the camino):
