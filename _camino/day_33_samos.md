It was a beautiful morning descent down the mountain. Franzi and Peter split ways from Lena and me again. They took the more direct route. We took the longer route to visit Samos, a town built around a Bendictine monastery. My love for Christian monasteries would not have me miss it. 

The morning light that shone on the mountainside was stunning as we descended. Walking down in a jovial easy manner, we were passed by a woman who carries a South African flag on her back. Her name was Joanne, I think. We would catch up with her later on an uphill as we got closer to Samos. 

There is something peculiar about memories from Camino. I don't remember most events and scenes from my life. But on the Camino, simple moments with strangers like Joanne somehow take on qualities of vividness and significance that make them worthy of being recalled. These memories live in my mind the way the fragrance of a tea would linger long after the tea is finished. I can still see the nonchalant but brisk way Joanne walked in front of us, with the golden soft sunlight from our right illuminating the whole mountainside.

We walked for over an hour before finding breakfast, per my usual routine. This chic place we stopped served oatmeal porridge, a welcome and exciting change from the the usual toast and eggs that can be found everywhere. I wondered if the new food options were showing up because the last leg of the Caminomore was more popular and busy.

Samos, our destination, was a small town situated within a quiet green valley. We stayed at the traditional albergue right beside the monastery. It was ran by volunteers, and all the bunk beds are in this one big room under a dome ceiling. The facilities were less well-equipped than the newer commercial albergues in town, but for me, the experience was closer to the heart. 

At the albergue, we met Lou-san again, our Japanese friend. Lou-san showed me how to take care of my bed bug bites. I must got them couple nights ago. The spots on my arms and neck had been gotten redder, bigger and itchier. He walked me to the local pharmacy, got the cortisone cream, and showed me a trick of applying the cream then wrapping the skin with plastic sheets before going to sleep to let the cream take effect slowly through the night. Just like when I had blisters, I felt grateful that there was an experienced pilgrim to help. I came to this journey carrying so little, but as I joined my footsteps with other pilgrims along this well-worn path, I felt more and more trust in that I could find all I needed in what the Camino provided and in the bonds I shared with my fellow pilgrims. As the bag felt lighter, the heart got fuller.

That evening, my friend Gary flew in from Canada and reached Sarria. He was now waiting for us to meet up tomorrow, so we can finish the last leg of this pilgrimage together.
