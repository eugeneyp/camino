I walked with Lena today. Having shared an experience of deep presence the night before, it felt like we knew each other in a way that was beyond the personal form/history, and beyond any words that needed to be said. I knew she travelled the same interior places that I did, and spoke the same language of how we make sense of the world. My whole being could relax with her. The connection felt comfortable and open and without any clinging or attachment.

On these last days of the Camino, I felt softer. Now I knew I would make it to Santiago. As each day came close to the end, I became more appreciative of the walk. I also allowed myself to be more connected. Before this, along the Camino, I met many interesting people, but for the most part, I stayed as a maverick and avoided being attached to anyone or any group. I was intent on finding my own rhythm and having the quiet space to listen closely to how the Camino, not just as a trail, but as a throbbing field of aliveness, wanted to guide me. Now, I allowed myself to fall into the companionship I shared with Lena (she knew the same quiet spaces). And soon, my long-time friend Gary would also join us.

*A chill albergue lounge where Lena and I stopped to hang out. There were food, drinks. Everything was donation-based. You can take anything you want.
