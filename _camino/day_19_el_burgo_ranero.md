Today I crossed the half-way point of my Camino. It was another long walk: 27.3km. I was getting more confident in my walking (again). The structure of my torso was more aligned and relaxed. I could breathe deeply in my belly. I walked at a faster pace even against strong wind.

Tricia, who was walking with her husband, Keith, as a retired couple from England, when I asked why she was walking the Camino, told me simply: I like feeling the wind in my hair. That might be the best answer I heard on the Camino. It cracked me open with lightheartedness. As a more serious person, it felt so freeing to hear such a simple light-hearted reason for walking the Camino. It gave me the permission to let go of any seeking for the spiritual, and walk for simply the pleasure of walking.

At El Burgo Ranero, all the albergues were full. So I shared a hotel room with Siggi, a mother from Germany whom I got acquainted with in my dorm the night before, and Calle, a 19 year old from Denmark, the youngest pilgrim I met. It fills my heart to feel my connections with these seemingly strangers whom I had to share so much with.
