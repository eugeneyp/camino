May 1, 2019
A tough day. Woken up at 6am by overhead speakers at the albergue playing Gregorian chants. I carried my pack and walked 21.5km. It was hot. I was tired and sore, and at one point, wanted to give up. While I was resting on the side, Sasha and Benno, a couple from Australia, whom bunked near me the night before, walked by and called my name. Walking and talking with Sasha picked up my energy and carried me to my destination, Zubiri.

Along the way, I saw Jackie, Pattie, and Tom; also Peter, who I would see again at the very end. I stopped by at a cafe and refueled with bread and a boiled egg. I also stopped by a refreshment trailer. Beside it was a bin with a sign that said if you drop in your underwear, it'll bring your luck in finding your next husband or wife on the Camino. I have heard of stories of people finding their love on the Camino. It was not in the foreground of my mind. Having just came off a significant international relationship, I was not in a state of mind where I was ready for another. Plus, I wanted the Camino to be about my relationship with God. But there were certainly opportunities for flirtations along the Camino. People were so open and friendly.

Many many days later, I met a man who said explicitly: "I am here to find my wife". He was the most well-groomed man I've met on the Camino. I even saw him putting on cologne in the morning.

I had a banana at the trailer. Later on, I realized that eating banana probably had too much of a cooling effect on my weakened body and probably contributed to the fatigue. I stayed away from bananas and icecream from the rest of Camino.

At Zubiri, in a bar/restaurant, I enjoyed meeting Tanya from Newzealand and Phil from Ireland. They were enjoying a drink while I had a baguette. 

By the time I reached Zubiri, all the beds have been booked. The next town is another 10km or so away. I was tired already and did not want to walk anywhere else. Rainer, this big German guy, was also looking. As we went from albergue to albergue, I bumped into the old Swedish couple whom I met on the first day. They said the lady at the albergue is booking them into a hotel nearby. So I agreed with Rainer to go share a room at the hotel. I saw two women wandering on the street like I was. Talking to them, I was excited to learn they were Norwegians, because I just lived there myself. I got them on the hotel reservation, and we were all happy to have a place to sleep for the night.

> The excitement of the beginning   
> gives way to the reality of the grind.  
> The beauty seen in the eyes  
> gives way to the pain in the feet.  
> Is this road really mine to walk?  
> I did not come here to punish myself or to prove myself --  
> I have done too much of that already.  
> I came looking for you.  
> For that imperceptibly soft embrace.
