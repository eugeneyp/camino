A moment this day had a profound impact on me for the rest of the Camino, and even til this day. It happened when I couldn't walk anymore and took a taxis. 

The day was so hot, and I was so tired, by the time I walked 3.5 hours, I had no will and motivation left to continue. I was usually so stubborn and fixated, but this day, I wanted to be kind to myself. So I took a taxis for 13 km.

Sitting in the car, in the comfort of the air-conditioning and the blast of music, I felt a deep longing as I watched other pilgrims toiling alongside the road under the heat. I realized that the comforts of the car removed me from the realness and raw intimacy of meeting life as it is. And in a flash, I saw that was how my whole life was lived out.

I quietly vowed to myself: I didn't want to take a car again on the journey. I didn't want to hide and skip the path that was mine to walk. I wanted to meet the ground with my rawness, my vulnerability, and my longings of intimacy.

When I got out of the car, I saw Vic again. I broke down and shared all that I experienced with him. He was incredibly kind and present and supportive. I felt inspired to keep on walking. When I got on the road again, I took in everything – the pain and the heat – with joy and gratefulness. 

At Carrión de los Condes, I stayed in an albergue ran by nuns. It was one of the most spacious and clean and generous places on the Camino. In the prayer room, as I meditated, I saw my tendency to reject the world, to run away spiritually. It was a reminder to turn back, to embrace the world and its joys and sufferings, its confined physical limitations, and its exquisiteness of the sensations. This was my labour of devotion on the Camino, to put my feet on the ground, to let go of the high-flying fantasies of the mind, so as to meet and kiss the earth.

That evening, the pilgrim's blessing from the nun sisters were beautiful and touching.
