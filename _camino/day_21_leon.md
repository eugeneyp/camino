A short 12km walk to enter Leon, perhaps the largest city on the Camino. I took advantage of it by enjoying my second Chinese meal at lunch. 

At the albergue San Francisco where I was staying, I was welcomed by brother Federico who was part of the Franciscan monastery. Sharing to him my enthusiasm for St. Francis and Assisi, brother Federico later invited me to stay with the brothers for a day of rest to deepen the spirituality of my pilgrimage. 

It was an amazing gift from the heart. we prayed together. He gave me blessings. He toured the city with me. Thank you, brother Federico.
