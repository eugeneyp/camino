After morning prayers in the church, I was welcomed by the Benedictine monks to move into the monastery as a guest. Along with me were Uwe, Siggi (both from Germany), and Cleo (Hong Kong). There were 4 monks, and as the hosts, they did everything. They cleaned and they cooked. They never asked what our plans were. The guests could stay as long as they wished. No fees were asked except for donations. They were also hilarious and entertaining in conversations.

Inside the monastery, there was a silence, as if it was a substance carefully guarded and cultivated within its walls.

I took the day to unwind, to follow the intuitions of my heart and body. 

I found a spot to rest in standing, and I wrote in my journal:
> Before taking the step close in, one must know where one stands. Before one can start a journey, one must arrive fully with all of himself into where he already is. 

\*The "step close in" was a reference to David Whyte's poem [Start Close In](https://startclosein.wordpress.com/start-close-in-the-poem-by-david-whyte/).

I walked about the town and the nearby farm fields. I wrote:
> A mysterious encounter with the horses, who walked up to me, unsuspectedly, as I was following my heart and bent down to pay attention to a fly on a tiny little flower on the ground. "Create in me a clean heart", I prayed. It called me to pay attention. The body is a wonderful instrument. I walked freely, fluidly, stretching, exercise all parts of me, taking pleasure and delight in this earthly existence. 

I felt a letting go of the way I was trying to complete the 800km Camino walk as a task, rather than really be free and paying attention. 
> Quietly, inside of me, I hear the whisper: I want to create my own way. I wan to walk my own way.
