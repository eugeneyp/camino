Leaving Villafranca del Bierzo, there were two paths going up a mountain. One was longer, with steeper ascents and descents, and more scenic. The other was shorter with a more even climb. Lena and I took the longer way, while Franzi and Peter took the shorter. 

The climb was beautiful. And I was really enjoying the company of Lena. 

> Like clear flowing river, our conversations and steps merge together in a flow, no hiding, fully in the light. The views, the scent, the wish-making, peeking into old churches in villages, a lunch stop (with pumpkin soup), laughing about my addiction to bread. What a beautiful gift, the companionship. 

We left at 8:30am and arrived at 4:45pm â€” a long day out on the walk, my longest so far, but it was enjoyable to have taken the time. We checked into an albergue at Ruitelan, where Franzi and Peter already arrived. It was a small, intimate albergue with a Buddhist vibe, ran by two older men who had been there since 1999. At the albergue I met Lou-san, a Japanese pilgrim with a colorful personality, whom I loved seeing

*Pumpkin soup for lunch. I appreciated the extra touch that the chef did to make the soup gourmet and nice. Because they didn't have to. As a pilgrim, I would have accepted anything common and simple.*

*Lena stopped a lot to take in the journey and smell the flowers, which was why we took so long. But it also inspired to me pay more attention and not just trying to get to the destination.*
