Another rest day at the Benedictine monastery. 

Reading the [monastery's website](https://monteirago.org/en/comunidad/), I was touched by this line:
> One of the most important things for a monastery is just **to be present amongst the people**. So our primary mission, as missionary monks is simply to be present on the Way of St James and make Jesus present, a pilgrim among us.

I had a private chat with father Paeus, who was 78 and still participating fully in the manual labors around the monastery. He took care of the gardens. And he made jams. It was touching to hear his life journey and the missionary work he did in Africa. 

That evening at Vespers, I was delighted to see Jackie, Patty, Johnny, whom I knew from Day 1. I also saw Nancy, a fellow Canadian I met in Hontanas. Talking to Nancy, I saw so much light in her. Light everywhere. In my journal, I wrote: light of Christ all around me.
