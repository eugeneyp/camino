Excitement for the first day of walking! I took an early morning train from Bayonne to St Jean Pied-de-Port, the official starting place for the French Way of the Camino. Off the train, along with the other pilgrims, I walked into town to register at the  Pilgrims office. Even though I slept poorly the night before, I walked with a gusto. The day is bright. It is almost 800km to Santiago de Compostela, and this is the start.

At the pilgrim's office, I collected my pilgrim's passport, where I will be collecting stamps along the way as a proof of my journey. I also picked up a shell, the most important signifier for a pilgrim. And I bought a walking stick, honestly not because I thought I really needed it, but because it makes me more like a pilgrim.

Then I set off, up the pyrenes mountain, a steep 3 hour climb to Orisson, my destination for the day, Orisson. A short trip for this first day, to easy my body into the pilgrimage.

The scenery of the climb was amazing. I did not come on the pilgrimate for the scenery. I came to honour my heart connection with God. I wanted to walk myself into a different reality. But the scenery, on not just for this first day, but on the whole Camino was stunning beyond what I expected. 

On this first day at the climb and at the albergue, I met many whom I would meet over and over again along the whole Camino: Jacki, Patti, and John from Australia; Michelle and her daughter Elizabeth from Tasmania; Barbara from California; Matt from Australia; Michael from England; an old Swedish couple whom helped me find accommodation few days later when I had no options; Valerie from Montreal; Dave from Winnipeg; Alan from Atlanta. A year later, their names and faces still remain fresh.  

When I reached the Albergue just before 1pm, I bought myself a soup and sandwich. I rested my legs and enjoyed the view out on the deck, looking down the mountain. Then I settled into the routine of having so much time: reading, resting, washing, laundry. 

The dinner that night was simple but a feast. We were well fed with unlimited refills. Stewed beef, pastas. About 35 of us. We went around, and each shared what brought them to the Camino. I remember what I said: I wanted to walk into my heart.

A start filled with energy, anticipation, and hope. 

My journal entry that day:
> There is the romantic idea of walking. And then there is the walking. The arduous stepping through the hills and valleys, stepping more into myself, into an inner reality. And being welcomed by strangers in unknown places known only to the heart.

*Up the pyrenes!*
