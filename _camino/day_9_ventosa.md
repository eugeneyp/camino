Today's walk was more difficult. The day was humid. After powering through 29 km the day before, I thought today's 19 km would be easy. It was not. Every day was different on the Camino.

I walked in the morning with Mikko from Finland. Two days ago, I saw him on the road struggling with a huge blister on his toe. I lent him some tape to take care of it. I didn't expect him to walk far. So when I saw him in the morning, I was surprised. Resilient guy. 

When passing through Navarette, I was astounded by the big church adorned with gold, in such a tiny town. I found that to be true in many small towns on the Camino. Spain in 13-15th century was rich with gold they took from South America.

Mikko stayed at Navarette, while I continued to Ventosa. On the way, I met Ninka from Netherland. An interesting woman. I struck up a conversation with her because I recognized the vivobarefoot boots she was wearing. I loved vivo barefoot shoes, but I would not dare to wear them for a long walk like this. So I was impressed with her. But she was walking slowly and struggling with blisters. Like Mikko, she thought she wouldn't make it to Santiago. But they both persisted and completed it. That's the Camino. You ride the highs and lows. Just when you are riding high, you get pulled down; and when you think you cannot go on, you received unexpected support to keep on going. And we shared our journeys with each other.

I enjoyed getting to know people's stories, especially what brought them to the Camino. You might be surprised to hear that most pilgrims did not identify as Christians and were not doing it for spiritual purposes. Some were doing it for the adventure. Mikko wanted to do it as a big challenge. Ninka was walking to forgive herself for being so hard on herself (*I would not have picked barefoot shoes if I did not want to be hard on myself, but I disgress*). Some did it as part of a life transition. Whatever the reasons were, there was usually a sense of connecting to something bigger than their life back home. Looking back at the memories now and all the people I met, I feel as if there was an incredible presence beneath the paths we walked, in every town we crossed, supporting all of us, tying us together in a bond of pilgrims across the centuries. It was an energetic field enacted and created by every step, every hand offered, every generosity given. The whole path is a gift.

More interesting people: at the albergue, I met an 82 year old Japanese man walking the Camino by himself! He had been doing this walk every year for the last 12 years. Also had dinner with Larry, Janet, Laney, and Max. Janet had an incredible presence that was clear and spacious. Larry, I felt a connection to, because he had been part of the Mankind project. I felt very supported by them.
