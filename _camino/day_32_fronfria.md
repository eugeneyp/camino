I was discovering more of who I was by being in Lena's companionship. It was easy to see that I could only be more of me through a connection with another.

> I have an inner fortress, protecting myself. She is the gentle waves of sea, slowly softening the fortress around my heart. 

And a simple moment that I hold dear in my memory:

> Another long and hot day. I had a moment of uttermost content, sitting back on the bench outside a cafe/bar, eating a self-made sandwich, beside Lena. She has a flower behind her ear. The butterflies dance in front of me. Sun is shining. As I said, utter contentment. 

Even now, I remember what that moment felt like in my body — a relaxed openness around my heart, a settledness in my body sitting on the bench, and a knowing that I was exactly where I was supposed to be. 

At one point during the day, I got annoyed and resentful at Lena, blaming her for our slow pace. I did not want to say it, but she sensed it when she shared her fear that she was slowing me down, and we were able to talk about it. I was grateful for that. 

I felt love for Lena. There was nothing romantic or sexual, and love was not even the right word. There was just an effortless openness and ease in sharing the walk with her. 

When we were 1 hour away from arrival, our walk became more determined, and we both noticed more thoughts in our mind. I had noticed this pattern before on the Camino — whenever I attached myself to a goal or destination, the body tensed and contracted, pushing energy up to the mind, creating loops of thoughts. It was a contrast against the contentment I felt earlier when I knew there was no where to go and no where to be except for the present moment.

*The [San Damiano cross](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Damiano_cross), which I cherish dearly, having visited it in Assisi. St. Francis, while praying in front of this cross, received God's call to rebuild the church. At first, he thought he was asked to repair the church building; but his mission went way further and changed the Catholic church from inside out.*
