Long day today. Extremely windy near the end. I was pressing into a strong head wind that was exhausting all my will power. I had the thought again that I might give up on the Camino. I did not come to punish myself or to prove myself. A part of me just could not stop being stubborn and trying so hard, and I felt compassion for it.

When I got to the albergue, I discovered a big blister on my right foot. I had secretly hoped that I was more attuned to my body than the average pilgrim was, and that I would take care of myself enough to avoid blisters. But here it was, a big blister on my foot, and I did not know how to deal with it. The truth is, it was impossible to avoid pain, physically and mentally (same as life). Almost every pilgrim I knew dealt with some pain or ache somewhere along the walk.

I still didn't want to deal with the blister, and hoped that it would soften on its own. But an older Italian in my dorm took a look and said: you need to pop it. That did not sound appealing to me. But I did it. He was a veteran and gave me a needle and antiseptics he packed for this specific purpose.

It felt like a rite of passage for me on the Camino -- popping my own blisters. And I had a mentor showing me the way.

At the albergue, I was reunited with Sasha and Benno, two of my favourite people on the Camino. We were together in Orisson on the very first day. We bunked right beside each other the next day at Roncesvalle. And on the way to Zubiri, walking with them gave me the energy I needed to finish.

I loved monasteries, and I stopped to visit every monastery I could. Looking at the photos of the monastery now, feeling the sense of total devotion that permeates the place, I can feel the purity and simplicity vibratingn in the heart. That vibration of purity and simplicity was what called me to let go of everything and walk the Camino, and it is still calling me now.

*I took a selfie every morning. Forgot the name of the German woman behind me. But I remember she said she was on the Camino to forget something.*
