After yesterday's event, I set out with a renewed motivation to do the walk faithfully. Between Carrión de los Condes and the next town is a 17km without any services. I walked part of the way with Andrea, a part-time boxing instructor from Milan. He was a small guy with a big energetic presence. He played music with a portable bluetooth speaker. Walking with him helped to pick me up from my sluggish energy.

As the day wore on, I picked up pace as my body warmed up. The Camino had been changing my body structure. My spines were decompressing and coming more into alignment so that the weight of the pack was mostly on the legs. I found I could walk without any tension in my torso, while having legs and feet be in smooth continual motions. The emptying of tension in upper body resulted in deep breathing and widened perceptual awareness. The experience was simultaneously open/receptive, and active/engaged. 

After the 17km stretch, I had a simple lunch. I bought some prosciutto at the local store to go with the baguette that I had with me. 

The afternoon got windy and drizzling. I met up with Barbara again. We pushed against the wind and reached Moratinos. The day's 29.9 km was my longest on the Camino.

At dinner, I enjoyed an intensely present connection with Rebecca, a fellow Canadian from BC.
