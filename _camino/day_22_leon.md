I accepted brother Federico's invitation and moved into the Franciscan monastery as a guest for the day. He prepared a guest suite for me. I shared all the meals and prayer time with the brothers, and had further time to talk with Federico.

The warm memory of that experience is reminding me and strenghtening me in my love and devotion for God.

I wrote in my journal:
> Federico is not just welcoming me in my small self but the Christ in me. Christ in him is sharing with the Christ in me. The love he gives he receives back because we share the life in the body of Christ.

*Paintings of St. Francis on the wall inside the monastery. St. Francis was so connected to nature. In one of his prayers, he called out to brother sun and sister moon.*
