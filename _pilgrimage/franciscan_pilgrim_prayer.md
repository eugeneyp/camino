title: Franciscan Pilgrim's Prayer
---

Although I may have traveled all the roads,  
crossed mountains and valleys from East to West,  
if I have not discovered the freedom to be myself,  
I have arrived nowhere.

Although I may have shared all of my possessions  
with people of other languages and cultures;  
made friends with Pilgrims of a thousand paths,  
or shared albergue with saints and princes,  
if I am not capable of forgiving my neighbor tomorrow,  
I have arrived nowhere.

Although I may have carried my pack from beginning to end  
and waited for every Pilgrim in need of encouragement,  
or given my bed to one who arrived later than I,  
given my bottle of water in exchange for nothing;  
if upon returning to my home and work,  
I am not able to create brotherhood  
or to make happiness, peace and unity,  
I have arrived nowhere.

Although I may have had food and water each day,  
and enjoyed a roof and shower every night;  
or may have had my injuries well-attended,  
if I have not discovered in all that the love of God,  
I have arrived nowhere. 

Although I may have seen all the monuments  
and contemplated the best sunsets;  
although I may have learned a greeting in every language  
or tasted the clean water from every fountain;  
if I have no discovered who is the author  
of so much free beauty and so much peace,  
I have arrived nowhere. 

If from today I do not continue walking on your path,  
searching and living according to what I have learned;  
if from today I do not see in every person, friend or foe  
a companion on the Camino;  
if from today I cannot recognize God,  
the God of Jesus of Nazareth  
as the one God of my life,  
I have arrived nowhere.
